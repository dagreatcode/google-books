// 6. Add the following Express routes for your app:

// * `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.

// * `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.

// * `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.

// * `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in `client/build/index.html`. 
//         Make sure you have this _after_ all other routes are defined.
